    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl is a quick, flavour-packed meal that’s perfect for busy weeknights or meal prep. Tender pieces of chicken are coated in a sticky, savoury-sweet teriyaki glaze made with soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger. Served over fluffy rice with your choice of steamed vegetables, it’s a balanced and satisfying dish that hits all the right notes—sweet, salty, and umami-rich with a fresh crunch from spring onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
