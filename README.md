# odin-recipes

This project is going to be a website that will have a main index page, along with links to recipes.

This website will be made using only HTML and therefore, will be the bare bones of a website, however I have not covered CSS at this stage in my learning.

At the end of the project, I would have demonstrated my ability to write basic HTML including using links to direct users to other webpages.
